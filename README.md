# pygraph
Custom graph package with (soon) several graph algorithm implementations. 

Implementations so far:
    - breadth-first-search
    - prim's and kruskal's algorithm
    - dijkstra and bellman-ford
    - nearest neighbour and double tree heuristic for Travelling Salesman Problem

Soon:
    - Maximum Flow: Edmonds-Karp Algorithm
    - Cost minimal flow: Cycle-cancelling algorithm and successive-shortest-paths algorithm
